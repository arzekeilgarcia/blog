Hi there! My name is Arzekeil-Abel Garcia De Leon and I'm from Mississauga, Ontario. I currently reside in Waterloo because I'm going to
Wilfrid Laurier University for Computer Science. I am a self proclaimed Web Developer that enjoys working mostly on the backend of a website.
This blog is just another way I like to express myself and show my love for software development. I will continute to write in hopes of helping
other people who are going down the same path as I am.

Feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:arzekil.abel@gmail.com)
